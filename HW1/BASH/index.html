        <p>Early computer usage adopted the teleprinter and teletype as a way to interact with computers. A user would type
            a
            command, then the machine would respond. This is the origin of "conversing" with a computer, especially through
            text. As CRT displays came into use, replacing paper output in the 60s and 70s, the interactive terminal became
            the
            primary way to interact with computers before Guided User Interfaces, or GUIs, became common place.
            BASH, or the Bourne Again Shell, was developed and released in 1989 for UNIX and UNIX-like Operating Systems as
            an
            alternative to proprietary "shells", which are the outermost user interfaces of operating systems. BASH is a
            command-line interpreter that functions as both an interactive shell and scripting language.
